# Personal General Security Notes

## Overview

This repository has been created as a way for me to collate my notes and understanding of security and auditing from the various learning resources that I have used, use, and will use.

I am undertaking, or planning to undertake, the following web3 security and auditing courses:

- Johnny Time (Blockchain Sec Academy) - Smart Contract Hacking (SCH) Parts 1 and 2 courses
  - Purchased 2023, commencement April, 2024
- Cyfrin Updraft's Security and Auditing Course
  - Commencement April, 2024
- Cyfrin Updraft's Assembly and Formal Verification Course
  - Planning to commence ~mid 2024


I will have public repositories for the Cyfrin courses, where I will also inlcude any files created during the course.

For the SCH courses, I will have public repositories but I will not provide restricted course material. It will contain specific notes on various topics.

I plan to take the broader Security and Auditing notes from each course and bring them into this repository.
